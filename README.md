Please refer to `README.md` in the `data` directory for the method of making a dataset.

## How Test and Train

### Test one image

```bash
$ python3 inference.py
```

### Train StarGAN-CelebA-128x128

```bash
python3 train.py --config_path ./configs/train/CelebA_128x128.yaml
```

### Resume train StarGAN-CelebA-128x128

Modify the `./configs/train/CelebA_128x128.yaml` file.

- line 44: `RESUMED_G_MODEL` change to `samples/StarGAN-CelebA-128x128/g_epoch_XXX.pth.tar`.
- line 45: `RESUMED_D_MODEL` change to `samples/StarGAN-CelebA-128x128/d_epoch_XXX.pth.tar`.

```bash
python3 train.py --config_path ./configs/train/CelebA_128x128.yaml
```

**Abstract** <br>
Recent studies have shown remarkable success in imageto-image translation for two domains. However, existing
approaches have limited scalability and robustness in handling more than two domains, since different models should
be built independently for every pair of image domains. To address this limitation, we propose StarGAN, a novel and
scalable approach that can perform image-to-image translations for multiple domains using only a single model.
Such a unified model architecture of StarGAN allows simultaneous training of multiple datasets with different domains
within a single network. This leads to StarGANâ€™s superior quality of translated images compared to existing models as
well as the novel capability of flexibly translating an input image to any desired target domain. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach on a facial attribute transfer and a facial expression synthesis tasks.
